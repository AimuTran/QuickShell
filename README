QuickShell is simple B/S rat,developed with php and C#

A web server with php works as Browser front,where you can give the orders.
and a exe program works on windows,which can fetch the orders you give and excute them.

The server will connect to the web server by GET or POST method.
The web server will log the online time of server.
The order that you give will be stored in MySQL until the order is fetched by server.

This rat is based on HTTP,so it wont occupy any port except 80.
